A more relaxed week this week, which I really needed. I’m looking forwards to focusing on hiring and design team strategy in the next few weeks. Also:

- I’ve been trawling through some of the new stuff announced at [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/), slightly disappointed to see no new computers [^1].
- I bought myself some new [in-ear headphones](https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/truly-wireless/wf-1000xm3) for summer, walking in this heat with over-ears isn’t much fun.
- I dusted off some service design knowledge and researched [experience prototyping](https://servicedesigntools.org/tools/experience-prototypes) for some client work. We’re testing a high-tech drive-thru restaurant.
- I’ve been getting back into podcasts recently. Merlins calendar wisdom on [‘Back to Work’](http://5by5.tv/b2w/533), was a bit of an epiphany.

[^1]: Let's just say that my current laptop gets a little _warm_ so new one will be needed soon.
