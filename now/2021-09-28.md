I’m really glad that autumn is arriving, summer is cool but Autumn is cooler. Also:

- I’m in the process of becoming a maintainer or our [internal design system](https://github.com/thoughtbot/design-system), I’m slowly learning the ropes of open-source project management.
- To cut down on emissions I’m thinking of [making my own](https://londonbookarts.org/about/) notebooks, it would be nice to make something totally custom.
- Since subscribing to [F1TV+](https://www.formula1.com) I’ve been really enjoying the current season, I haven’t watched a full season for years.
